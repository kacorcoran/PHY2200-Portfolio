Kyle's Portfolio

This is a collection of all of the projects that I have made throughout the semester in my computational physics class.  Each file has some extra packages or data that gets read into the notebook, so I have included all of them so you can run the notebooks correctly.

One big package to install on your computer is mplEasyAnimate so you can run some of the animations that I create.  This is a package available on pip.
